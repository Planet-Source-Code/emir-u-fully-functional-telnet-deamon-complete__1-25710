## Fully functional telnet Deamon \(COMPLETE\)


</div>

### Description

Forgot to include a .bas file in my last posting, so here it is again. If you downloaded it and it wouldnt work because it was missing a modProcess.bas then this should fix it .

This is a fully functional telnet deamon. It is capable of fully controlling the remote file system as well as creating data pipes and gathering information all controllable from a standard windows telnet client. It also implements basic stealth features and password verification. If you are interested in learning how basic servers work this code is very much for you. Try not to treat it too seriously, this little app was made as a toy to play around with on my system.
